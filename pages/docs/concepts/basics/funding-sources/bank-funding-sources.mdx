# Funding source verification

Before a customer is eligible to transfer money from their bank or credit union account they need to verify ownership of the account, either via micro-deposits, Instant Account Verifications (IAV), or Plaidâ€™s Auth. Following are the different methods that you can add and verify a bank account as a funding-source to your Customers.

* [Plaid Auth for account authentication in seconds](https://developers.dwolla.com/guides/funding-sources/plaid)
