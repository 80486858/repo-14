- `http_retry_max` (\*int) - The maximum number of retries for requests that fail with a 429 or 500-level error.
  The default value is 5. Set to 0 to disable reties.

- `http_retry_wait_max` (\*float64) - The maximum wait time (in seconds) between failed API requests. Default: 30.0

- `http_retry_wait_min` (\*float64) - The minimum wait time (in seconds) between failed API requests. Default: 1.0

- `space_object_name` (string) - The name of the key used in the Space where the image file will be copied
  to for import. This is treated as a [template engine](/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine).
  Therefore, you may use user variables and template functions in this field.
  If not specified, this will default to `packer-import-{{timestamp}}`.

- `skip_clean` (bool) - Whether we should skip removing the image file uploaded to Spaces after
  the import process has completed. "true" means that we should leave it in
  the Space, "false" means to clean it out. Defaults to `false`.

- `image_tags` ([]string) - A list of tags to apply to the resulting imported image.

- `image_description` (string) - The description to set for the resulting imported image.

- `image_distribution` (string) - The name of the distribution to set for the resulting imported image.

- `timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The length of time in minutes to wait for individual steps in the process
  to successfully complete. This includes both importing the image from Spaces
  as well as distributing the resulting image to additional regions. If not
  specified, this will default to 20.
