# Quick start example

This package contains sample usage for Jet framework.

Jet generated files of interest are in ./gen folder.

quick-start.go contains code explained at [README.md](../../README.md#quick-start),
with difference of redirecting json output to files(dest.json and dest2.json) rather then to a
standard output.

./gen, dest.json and dest2.json - added to git for presentation purposes.
