Ideally we would want to achieve the following:
* have the LATEST aio-lib-java aem package to always be deployed to the LATEST version  of skyline
* and have either
  * a github action to call a few aem servlet endpoints to validate my  aio-lib-java aem package is functional
  * or have an IT Test that can run in the CM pipeline.
     * There’s a GH action out there that Justin created that will start a CM pipeline from GH
     * So we could create a normal AEM project as a sub-folder set in your AIO Lib repo. point CM to your public GH repo and subfolder.
       Tell GH whenever a merge occurs, run the CM Prod pipeline.

However we are limited by due to Sandbox systems: we will probably not be able to achieve the above
* Sandboxes hibernate
* And Sandboxes, AFAIK cannot be onboarded onto RV/RO - 
* and there’s no public API to update an environment to the latest version of the product. 
  * That requires manual user intervention, just like unhibernating.
