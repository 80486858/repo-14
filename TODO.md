- Currently, the design tokens are immediately released. Would it make sense to first create a pull request?
- The new design tokens need to be installed manually in lyne-components. would it make sense to:
  - ... trigger a build of lyne-components automatically?
  - ... create a pull requests at lyne-components with the new design tokens?
