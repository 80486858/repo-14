- Currently, the Design Tokens will get released immediately. Would it make sense to first create a pull request?
- The new Design Tokens need to be installed manually in lyne-components. would it make sense to:
  - ... trigger a build of lyne-components automatically?
  - ... create a pull requests at lyne-components with the new Design Tokens?
