# sorbet-rails
Set of tools to make sorbet work with rails seamlessly.

This gem adds a few rake tasks to generate RBI for dynamic methods generated by Rails. It also includes sigs for related Rails classes. The generated rbis are added to `sorbet/rails-rbi/` folder.

Please feel free to send PR requests or file issues to improve the functionality of the gem!

# Routes rbi
The following rake task generates `_path` and `_url` methods for all named routes defined in `routes.rb`
```
  rake rails_rbi:routes
```
# Models rbi
The following rake task generates rbi files for all models in the Rails App (all descendants of ActiveRecord::Base)
```
  rake rails_rbi:models
```
You can also regenerate rbi files for specific models
```
  rake rails_rbi:models[ModelName,AnotherOne,...]
```
At the moment, the generation task generate the following signatures
- Column getters & setters
- Associations getters & setters
- Enum values, checkers & scopes
- Named scopes
- Model relation class
