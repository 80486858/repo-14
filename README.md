# sorbet-rails
Set of tools to make sorbet work with rails seamlessly.

This gem adds a few rake tasks to generate RBI for dynamic methods generated by Rails. It also includes sigs for related Rails classes. The generated rbis are added to `sorbet/rails-rbi/` folder.

Please feel free to send PR requests or file issues to improve the functionality of the gem!

## Initial setup

Following the steps below to setup the rbis after `srb tc`
1. Include ActiveRecord RBI
```
  $ srb tc sorbet-typed
```
2. Generate routes RBI
```
  $ rake rails_rbi:routes
```
3. Generate models RBI
```
  $ rake rails_rbi:models
```
4. Auto-upgrade the typecheck level of files
```
  $ srb tc --suggest-typed --typed=strict --error-white-list=7022 -a
```
Because we've generated RBI files for models & routes, a lot more files should be type-checkable now

## ActiveRecord RBI

There are ActiveRecord RBI that we vendor with this gem. Please run `srb tc sorbet-typed` to include the provided RBI in your `sorbet/rbi_list`

## Routes RBI
The following rake task generates `_path` and `_url` methods for all named routes defined in `routes.rb`
```
  rake rails_rbi:routes
```
## Models RBI
The following rake task generates rbi files for all models in the Rails App (all descendants of ActiveRecord::Base)
```
  rake rails_rbi:models
```
You can also regenerate rbi files for specific models
```
  rake rails_rbi:models[ModelName,AnotherOne,...]
```
At the moment, the generation task generate the following signatures
- Column getters & setters
- Associations getters & setters
- Enum values, checkers & scopes
- Named scopes
- Model relation class

## Trick & Tips
### `find`, `first` and `last` 
These 3 methods can either return a single nilable record or an array of records. Sorbet does not allow us to define multiple sigs for a function. It doesn't support defining one function sig that has varying returning value depending on the input param type. We opt to define the most commonly used sig for these methods, and monkey-patch new functions for the secondary use.

In short:
- Use `find`, `first` and `last` to fetch a single record
- Use `find_n`, `first_n`, `last_n` to fetch an array of records.

### `find_by` vs `find_by_<attributes>`
We've added sigs for `find_by!` and `find_by`. However, we do not generate individual `find_by_<attributes>` methods. Please consider refactor the `find_by_<attributes>` function calls to `find_by` or `find_by!`. It's also recommended by RuboCop to use `find_by` over the dynamic siblings!

### `after_commit` and other callbacks
Consider codemod-ing `after_commit` callbacks to use instance method functions. Sorbet doesn't support binding an optional block with a different context. Because of this, when using a callback with a custom block, the block is evaluated in the wrong context (Class-level context). 

```
after_commit do ... end
```
codemod to 
```
after_commit :after_commit_func
def after_commit_func
  ...
end
```

### Look for `# typed: ignore` files

Because sorbet initial setup tries to flag files at the typecheck level that generates 0 errors, there may be files in your repository that is `# typed: ignore`. This is because sometimes Rails allow very dynamic code that Sorbet does not regard as typecheck-able. 

It is worth going through the list of files that is ignored and resolve them (and auto upgrade the types of other files -- see Initial Setup #4). Usually this will resolve in many more files typecheckable.
